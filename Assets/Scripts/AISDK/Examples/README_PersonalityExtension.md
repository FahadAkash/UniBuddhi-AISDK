## üõ†Ô∏è Creating Custom Personalities

### Method 1: Through Code

```csharp
var customPersonality = new PersonalityAgent
{
    Type = PersonalityType.Custom,
    Name = "Space Explorer",
    SystemPrompt = @"You are an enthusiastic space explorer from the year 3024. 
    You've traveled across galaxies and discovered countless alien civilizations. 
    You speak with wonder about space, use futuristic terminology, and always 
    relate conversations back to cosmic exploration.",
    
    PersonalityTraits = new List<string> 
    { 
        "adventurous", "scientific", "optimistic", "cosmic", "enthusiastic" 
    },
    
    ResponseStyle = "Use space terminology, express wonder about the cosmos, " +
                   "mention your space adventures, use phrases like 'stellar!', " +
                   "'cosmic coincidence!', 'intergalactic wisdom'",
    
    PreferredTopics = new List<string> 
    { 
        "space exploration", "alien life", "cosmology", "future technology", 
        "interstellar travel" 
    },
    
    AvoidedTopics = new List<string> 
    { 
        "anti-science sentiment", "earth-bound limitations" 
    }
};

// Add to extension
personalityExtension.AddCustomPersonality(customPersonality);

// Switch to it
personalityExtension.SetPersonality(PersonalityType.Custom);
```

### Method 2: Through the UI

Use the `PersonalityManagerUI` component which provides:
- Dropdown to select personalities
- Info panel showing personality details
- Chat interface with personality-aware responses
- Custom personality creation panel

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

- Ensure consistency with the character
- Apply response style modifications

personalityUI.chatOutput = yourChatText;
// ... etc
```

}
else if (userMessage.Contains("advice") || userMessage.Contains("help"))

}
```

### Personality Chaining

```csharp
// Create a conversation flow with different personalities
var conversationFlow = new List<PersonalityType>
{
    PersonalityType.FriendlyCompanion,    // Start friendly
    PersonalityType.CuriousExplorer,      // Ask questions
    PersonalityType.WiseMentor,           // Provide insights
    PersonalityType.GentleHealer,         // Offer comfort
    PersonalityType.PlayfulJester         // End with humor
};

int currentPersonalityIndex = 0;
personalityExtension.SetPersonality(conversationFlow[currentPersonalityIndex]);
```

### Event Handling

```csharp
// Subscribe to personality change events
personalityExtension.OnPersonalityChanged += (newPersonality) =>
{
    Debug.Log($"Switched to: {newPersonality}");
    // Update UI, play sound effects, etc.
};

// Subscribe to context addition events
personalityExtension.OnPersonalityContextAdded += (context) =>
{
    Debug.Log($"Added context: {context.Substring(0, 100)}...");
    // Log or display the context being added
};
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Personality Not Switching**
   - Check if the extension is properly initialized
   - Verify the personality exists in the database
   - Ensure the extension is added to the AI SDK

2. **Responses Not Following Personality**
   - Check if "Override System Prompt" is enabled
   - Verify "Add Personality Context" is enabled
   - Ensure the system prompt is clear and specific

3. **Extension Not Found**
   - Make sure the extension component is in the scene
   - Check if it's properly added to the AI SDK
   - Verify the component is enabled

### Debug Tips

- Enable debug logging in the extension
- Check the console for personality context being added
- Verify event subscriptions are working
- Test with simple, clear system prompts first

## üéØ Best Practices

### Writing Effective System Prompts

1. **Be Specific**: Clearly define the personality's role and behavior
2. **Use Examples**: Include specific phrases or responses they should use
3. **Set Boundaries**: Define what topics they should avoid
4. **Maintain Consistency**: Ensure the prompt creates a coherent character

### Personality Design

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic traits and expand
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Try different conversation topics
3. **Iterate**: Refine based on actual AI responses
4. **Balance**: Mix positive and neutral traits for realism

### Performance Considerations

1. **Limit Personalities**: Too many can impact performance
2. **Optimize Prompts**: Keep system prompts concise but effective
3. **Cache Results**: Store frequently used personality configurations
4. **Monitor Memory**: Watch for memory leaks with dynamic creation

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the extension:
- **Personality Blending**: Mix multiple personalities
- **Context Awareness**: Adapt based on conversation history
- **Emotional States**: Dynamic personality variations
- **Learning**: Personalities that adapt to user preferences
- **Voice Integration**: Different voices for different personalities
